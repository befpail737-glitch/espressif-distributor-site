                    <h1>Troubleshooting Common Wi-Fi Connectivity Issues on ESP32</h1>
                    <div class="article-meta"><!-- ... Author Info & Tags ... --></div>
                    <p>One of the most common support requests we receive involves Wi-Fi connectivity problems. This guide covers the top three issues our FAEs encounter and how to solve them.</p>
                    <h3>1. The Device Fails to Connect to the AP</h3>
                    <p>This is the most frequent starting problem. Follow these diagnostic steps in order:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Check Credentials:</strong> The simplest mistake is a typo in the SSID or password. Double-check them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Get the Disconnect Reason:</strong> In your ESP-IDF code, register an event handler for `WIFI_EVENT_STA_DISCONNECTED`. The event data will contain a reason code. Codes like `WIFI_REASON_NO_AP_FOUND` or `WIFI_REASON_AUTH_FAIL` will tell you exactly what's wrong.</li>
                        <li><strong>Check Your Antenna:</strong> Is the antenna connected properly? If using a PCB trace antenna, was its design (and the required keep-out area) followed exactly as specified in the module datasheet? A poor antenna is a very common hardware issue.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>2. High Latency or Packet Loss</h3>
                    <p>If the device connects but the connection is poor, investigate these causes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Signal Strength (RSSI):</strong> Print the RSSI value. A value below -75dBm is considered a poor signal and can lead to instability. Try moving the device closer to the router.</li>
                        <li><strong>RF Interference:</strong> Other 2.4GHz devices (microwaves, cordless phones, other Wi-Fi networks) can cause interference. Try changing the Wi-Fi channel on your router.</li>
                        <li><strong>Power Supply Issues:</strong> Wi-Fi transmission is a power-intensive operation. A weak or unstable power supply can cause "brownouts" where the chip resets or the radio fails. Ensure your power supply can handle current spikes of 300-400mA. Add a large capacitor (e.g., 220uF) close to the module's power pins.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>3. Device Disconnects Randomly</h3>
                    <p>This is often the hardest problem to debug. Besides the power supply issues mentioned above, consider:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Software Bugs:</strong> A memory leak in your application could cause a crash and reset. Monitor free heap memory over time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Router Behavior:</strong> Some routers may kick off devices they deem inactive. Ensure you are sending periodic traffic (e.g., a PING or MQTT keep-alive) to maintain the connection.</li>
                    </ul>
